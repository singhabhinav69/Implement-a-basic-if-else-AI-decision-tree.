# Implement-a-basic-if-else-AI-decision-tree

Sure! Below is an example of a basic AI decision tree using if-else conditions in Python. This simple decision tree can be used as a framework for more complex decision-making systems.

Example: Basic AI Decision Tree in Python
This AI will make decisions based on user input. It's a simple decision tree where the program asks the user a series of yes/no questions, and based on the responses, it will makea decision.

Explanation:
First decision point: The program asks if you like sunny weather. If you say "yes", it moves on to the next question about going for a walk. If you say "no", it asks if you prefer indoor activities.
Nested decisions: Based on the user's answers, the program provides suggestions (e.g., walking outside, staying indoors with a book, etc.).

How to Use:
Copy the code to a Python file, e.g., decision_tree.py.
Run the file in your terminal or IDE.
Answer the questions, and the program will guide you through the decision-making process.
Extending the Decision Tree:
You can expand this decision tree by adding more questions or even incorporating more complex decision-making logic such as probabilities, machine learning models, or deeper decision trees. But for a basic example, this should give you a good starting point.
